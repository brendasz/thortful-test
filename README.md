Thortful test

This is a very simple application where the user can search for names stored in a JSON file.

When the user inputs some text in the search bar, the text will be taken to a filter and checked if it's similar to any name from the JSON file. It's being checked using the indexOf method.

I've created a node server by running 'npm install -g http-server' and after that I was able to run the app using 'http-server -o'
